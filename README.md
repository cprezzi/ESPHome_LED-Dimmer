This is a small PCB for crating a ESPHome LED-Dimmer for 12V LED.Spots, Stripes and COB-Lights.
The PCB is hosting an ESP32-C3 Supermini, a Mini Buck-Converter for 12V > 5V conversion and a Mosfet for PWM-switching the LEDs. 

ESPHome is used as the firmware on the ESP32-C3 (configured as PWM output).

The board is capable of driving LEDs up to 12V/5A.
